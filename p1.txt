1.We create indexes on team and salaries table to speed up selection

2.There are redundant operations:
	FROM (
		SELECT
		teams.yearID,
		teamSalary AS winningSalary
		FROM teams, (
		SELECT
		yearID,
		teamID,
		sum(salary) teamSalary
		FROM salaries
		GROUP BY yearId, teamID
		) teamSalaries;
The subquery was called twice. We created a view for this so that it didn't have to be generated twice.
